            The malinois has many traits that are expected of a herding breed. High intelligence, alertness and willingness to be active.
            He is happiest after demanding work, training or play sessions, as he needs plenty physical and mental stimuli.
            Protecting his family is a natural instinct.
            <br>
            However, all these things can turn into negatives if he is neglected. To combat his boredom, he will decide to keep himself busy,
            which often results in destructive behaviour. He might also become anxious or aggressive.
