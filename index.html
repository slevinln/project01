        <h2>Are you considering getting a malinois?</h2>
        <p>Originally a herding dog from belgium, the malinois - a type of belgian shepherd - sees a steady increase in popularity both as a 
           working dog and a familiy dog. No surprise, given their capabilities
           <br>
           But! They are a high-drive, challenging breed and can go dangerously out of control if not properly raised. This is not a dog you pick for his looks!
           However, to help you figure out if this IS your kind of dog, you've come to the right place. Browse the website to find out more about the history
           of the breed, their temper, how to train/work them and suitable toys/food. And if you feel like it, you can sign up for our newsletter to get news
           about tournament performances, working dog feats and other interesting tidbits!
