            Exhaustive training is a must! Just going on walks won't cut it. Thankfully, with their strong willingness to work,
            many different kinds of training are possible. Obedience walks are a great way to work both mind and body. 
            Scent work is an absolute favorite not only for malinois, as using their powerful noses is very stimulating for their brain
            and allows them high performance without being too physically demanding. Don't forget play sessions like fetching tennis balls
            or tugging, having a good time with their owner and vice versa is very important for your relationship!
